# 🧩 Game Engine Fundamentals – Open the Door!

Hey there, fellow DAE student, puzzle solver, or Unreal enthusiast 👋  
Welcome to my **Game Engine Fundamentals (Unreal)** repository — a project developed during the **third semester (2024)** at **DAE**.

---

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains my **Unreal Engine 5 project**, created for the **Game Engine Fundamentals** course.  
The assignment was to design an original game prototype inspired by **two randomly assigned words** — mine were **_piece elimination_** and **_glimpse_**.  

The result is a **first-person puzzle game** built around logic, timing, and AI control, where the player solves progressively harder rooms by manipulating energy sources, machines, and autonomous units.
